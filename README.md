## The problem

Managing workshop repositories. A great way to do a workshop repo is to have `exercises` and
`exercises-final` directories. The problem is keeping these two directories in sync.

## This solution

This allows you to create a template for both of these in a `templates` directory. Based on special
text in these files, you can specify what parts of the file you want in `exercises` and
`exercises-final`. This allows you to co-locate what you're going to be showing workshop attendees
and what the final answer should be.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and should
be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev split-guide
```

## Usage

### Video

I recorded a video to teach people how to use `split-guide` and contribute to one of my workshops:

[![split-guide-video](other/split-guide-video.png)](https://youtu.be/CSVOPw_5OT0)

### CLI

This module is a CLI. The best place for it is in your npm scripts
(or [`package-scripts.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-s)):

```javascript
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "split-guide generate"
  }
}
```

This will take all the templates you have in `templates` and create corresponding files in new
`exercises` and `exercises-final` directories.

#### generate

This is currently the only available command. Below is a list of the available options (which are parsed with
the amazing [yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs)):

##### `--templates-dir`

Defaults to `./templates`. This is where `split-guide` will look for your template files
Whatever you provide will be be resolved as relative to where you're executing the command (`process.cwd`) (if you're
using npm scripts, that will be where the `package.json` file is located).

`split-guide` will use this to generate a glob that looks like this: `${templatesDir}/**/*`. If you wish to ignore
certain files, you can use the [ignore](#--ignore) option.

##### `--exercises-dir`

Defaults to `./exercises`. This is where `split-guide` will put your exercises files
Whatever you provide will be be resolved as relative to where you're executing the command (`process.cwd`) (if you're
using npm scripts, that will be where the `package.json` file is located).

##### `--exercises-final-dir`

Defaults to `./exercises-final`. This is where `split-guide` will put your exercises-final files
Whatever you provide will be be resolved as relative to where you're executing the command (`process.cwd`) (if you're
using npm scripts, that will be where the `package.json` file is located).

##### `--no-clean`

Defaults to `false`. This will tell `split-guide` to not remove the `exercises` and `exercises-final` directories. This
is useful if you're manually putting files into those directories and don't want to have to do that every time you run
`split-guide`. Normally you probably shouldn't be using this.

##### `--ignore`

Defaults to `undefined`. Can accept multiple values. This will be passed along to `glob` when `split-guide` identifies
the template files. See the [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) docs. Note that you may want to pass this
argument in quotes as glob patterns can cause issues in the command line:

```
split-guide generate --ignore "**/*.ignored.js" "**/build/**/*"
```

##### `--silent-success`

By default, `split-guide` will log out how many and which files were saved. Add this to prevent that.

##### `--silent-all`

This will do the same as `--silent-success` but will also silence any errors. It's not recommended to use this option.

### Templates

There are three directives you can use in your files. Each of these is used with a `START` and `END`.

#### Directives

##### COMMENT

Anything in this directive will not appear in the final output of either `exercises` or
`exercises-final`. This is useful to keep notes to yourself about why your template looks a certain
way.

##### WORKSHOP

Anything in this directive will only appear in the `exercises`. This is a good place to add
comments for what the workshoppers should be working on in this part of the code.

##### FINAL

Anything in this directive will only appear in the `exercises-final`. This is a good place to put what the
end result of your workshop should look like.

#### Using directives

Templates can be in any text file format (`.js`, `.md`, `.txt`, etc...). Here's an example of a `.js`
template that uses all of the directives:

**templates/exercise-01/foo.js**

```javascript
// COMMENT_START
// this is the top of the file, and it has comments
// COMMENT_END
module.exports = function sum(a, b) {
  // FINAL_START you can put comments on the same line too
  return a + b
  // FINAL_END
  // WORKSHOP_START
  // return the sum of a and b
  // WORKSHOP_END and on the end line and stuff too
}
```

Given this input, the output would be:

**exercises/exercise-01/foo.js**

```javascript
module.exports = function sum(a, b) {
  // return the sum of a and b
}
```

**exercises-final/exercise-01/foo.js**

```javascript
module.exports = function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

## FAQ:

**How do I make it so a file only appears in one of the output directories?**

If the resulting string is empty, then no file will be written. For example, this file would only
appear in exercises-final:

```markdown
// FINAL_START
This will only go into the final directory
// COMMENT_START
this is a comment that wont even appear in the final directory
// COMMENT_END
because the result is an empty string for the exercises directory
// FINAL_END
```

## Inspiration

I've done quite a few workshops that follow similar patterns to this one. I was on an airplane when
I wrote most of this code and I had a blast. So it was inspiring to me :)

## Other Solutions

I am unaware of other solutions. Feel free to submit a PR if you know of similar solutions.
